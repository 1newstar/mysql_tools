this is used for processing ibd file without a frm file. you need to guess some fileds, or you want to dump it by yourself, but not the current tool.

Otherwise, if you already have both frm and ibd files, you can just use percona-data-recovery-tool-for-innodb for recovery.

pls. rewrite the code for your table structure.
